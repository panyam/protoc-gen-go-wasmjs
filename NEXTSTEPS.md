# Next Steps

## Recently Completed (August 2025)
- âœ… **Proto to JSON Conversion System**: Implemented flexible conversion options to handle differences between Go protojson and TypeScript protobuf libraries
  - Added `ConversionOptions` interface with `handleOneofs`, `fieldTransformer`, `emitDefaults`, and `bigIntHandler`
  - Enhanced error handling with better context
  - Added runtime configuration via `setConversionOptions()`
  - Updated WASM-side with better protojson marshal/unmarshal options
  - Created comprehensive documentation in `PROTO_CONVERSION.md`

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] **Browser Demo**: Create a complete browser demo showcasing the proto conversion features
  - Demonstrate oneof field handling
  - Show field name transformation in action
  - Include BigInt serialization examples
  
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Benchmark the conversion overhead
  - Measure impact of custom conversions
  - Optimize hot paths in the conversion system
  - Add performance monitoring hooks

- [ ] **Type-Aware Conversion**: Enhance conversion system with proto type information
  - Detect oneof fields from proto descriptors instead of heuristics
  - Better BigInt field detection based on proto field types
  - Support for Well-Known Types (Timestamp, Duration, etc.)

## Short Term (Next Month)
- [ ] **Streaming Support**: Research and implement streaming RPC support for WASM
  - Server-streaming RPCs
  - Client-streaming RPCs
  - Bidirectional streaming
  
- [ ] **Advanced Templates**: Template inheritance and partial overrides
  - Allow extending base templates
