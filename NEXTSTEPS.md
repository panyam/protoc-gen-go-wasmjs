# Next Steps

## Recently Completed (January 2025)
- âœ… **Major Architecture Simplification**: Successfully completed TypeScript architecture transformation
  - **Self-Contained TypeScript Generation**: Eliminated dependencies on external TypeScript generators (protoc-gen-es, protoc-gen-ts)
  - **Simplified Client Architecture**: Replaced complex conversion system with direct JSON serialization
  - **Template-Based Generation**: Implemented interfaces, models, and factory generation using Go templates
  - **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed obsolete fields and streamlined configuration options
  - **Default Value Handling**: Fixed array and message type defaults with proper optional field support
  - **End-to-End Testing**: Validated complete architecture with working examples
