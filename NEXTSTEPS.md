# Next Steps for protoc-gen-go-wasmjs

## ✅ Completed Work (Phase 4)

### Split Architecture Successfully Implemented
- **Go Generator (`protoc-gen-go-wasmjs-go`)**: Fully functional, generates WASM wrappers
- **TypeScript Generator (`protoc-gen-go-wasmjs-ts`)**: Fully functional, generates TypeScript clients
- **Both generators tested** with simple and complex examples

### Critical Bug Fixes Applied

#### Go Generator Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing wasm package import** - Now always included for WASM generation
2. **Empty request/response types** - Properly qualified with package aliases
3. **Protobuf wire protocol corruption** - Removed all stdout writes
4. **Template execution verification** - Added proper error handling

#### TypeScript Generator Issues Fixed:
1. **Template data structure mismatches** - Created TypeScript-specific data structures
2. **Missing fields** - Added all required fields (APIStructure, JSNamespace, etc.)
3. **Boolean logic errors** - Fixed template conditionals with HasMessages/HasEnums flags
4. **Stdout corruption** - Removed fmt.Printf calls

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Fix Template Inheritance Issues (Priority: CRITICAL) 
Currently generated TypeScript has compilation errors:
- **Missing base class properties**: `wasmLoadPromise`, `browserServiceManager` not accessible
- **Missing methods**: `registerBrowserService`, `createAndDeserialize` not found
- **Map entry type generation**: Proto maps create missing `*Entry` type references
- **Constructor ordering**: `super()` call placement in generated classes

### 2. Complete Runtime Package Integration (Priority: HIGH)
- **Fix import resolution**: Ensure `@protoc-gen-go-wasmjs/runtime` resolves correctly
- **Add missing base methods**: `registerBrowserService` to `WASMServiceClient`
- **Test inheritance chain**: Verify all base class functionality is accessible
- **Validate runtime package build**: Ensure all exports work correctly

### 3. TypeScript Development Environment (Priority: HIGH)
- **Complete Vite setup**: Finish modern TypeScript project structure
- **pnpm workspace**: Properly link runtime package as workspace dependency
- **Eliminate build scripts**: Replace manual esbuild with Vite bundling
- **Dev server integration**: Hot reload with TypeScript compilation

### 4. Browser-Callbacks Example Validation (Priority: HIGH)
- **Fix generated code issues**: Resolve all TypeScript compilation errors
- **Test full workflow**: WASM ↔ Browser service communication
- **Validate UI functionality**: Ensure demo works end-to-end
- **Performance validation**: Confirm no regressions from runtime package approach

## 📋 Medium-Term Goals

### 1. Feature Parity
- Ensure all features from monolithic generator work in split version
- Streaming support verification
- Custom template support
- All filtering options working

### 2. Migration Guide
- Document migration from old to new generators
- Create compatibility wrapper if needed
- Update all examples to use new generators

### 3. Documentation
- Complete API documentation for all layers
- Usage guide for split generators
- Template customization guide
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### 4. CI/CD Integration
- Add GitHub Actions for testing
- Automated release process
- Version compatibility matrix

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

### 1. Additional Language Support
- Consider Python WASM generator
- Rust WASM generator
- Other target languages as needed

### 2. Advanced Features
- Hot reload support for development
- Source map generation
- Advanced debugging capabilities
- Performance profiling tools

### 3. Ecosystem Integration
- Buf Schema Registry integration
- VS Code extension
- Build tool plugins (webpack, vite, etc.)
- Framework integrations (React, Vue, Angular)

## 📊 Technical Debt to Address

1. **TODO Comments**: Several TODO items in code need addressing:
   - Field analysis in TSDataBuilder
   - External imports in TSDataBuilder
   - Oneof group analysis
   - Browser service detection

2. **Template Consolidation**:
   - Review if templates can be simplified
   - Consider template inheritance/composition

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Improve error messages with more context
   - Add suggestions for common issues

4. **Performance**:
   - Consider parallel generation for large projects
   - Template caching for repeated use
   - Memory usage optimization

## ✅ Success Criteria for Production Release

- [ ] All examples generate and run successfully
- [ ] Performance within 10% of old generator
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Migration guide available
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Community feedback incorporated

## 📝 Notes

The refactoring to a split architecture has been successful. The new design provides:
- Better testability through layer separation
- Cleaner code organization
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Language-specific optimizations
- Improved error handling

The generators are now ready for broader testing and community feedback before the production release.
