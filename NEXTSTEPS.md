# Next Steps for protoc-gen-go-wasmjs

## ✅ Completed Work (Phase 4)

### Split Architecture Successfully Implemented
- **Go Generator (`protoc-gen-go-wasmjs-go`)**: Fully functional, generates WASM wrappers
- **TypeScript Generator (`protoc-gen-go-wasmjs-ts`)**: Fully functional, generates TypeScript clients
- **Both generators tested** with simple and complex examples

### Critical Bug Fixes Applied

#### Go Generator Issues Fixed:
1. **Missing wasm package import** - Now always included for WASM generation
2. **Empty request/response types** - Properly qualified with package aliases
3. **Protobuf wire protocol corruption** - Removed all stdout writes
4. **Template execution verification** - Added proper error handling

#### TypeScript Generator Issues Fixed:
1. **Template data structure mismatches** - Created TypeScript-specific data structures
2. **Missing fields** - Added all required fields (APIStructure, JSNamespace, etc.)
3. **Boolean logic errors** - Fixed template conditionals with HasMessages/HasEnums flags
4. **Stdout corruption** - Removed fmt.Printf calls

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Field Analysis for TypeScript Types (Priority: HIGH)
Currently, TypeScript message fields are empty (`Fields: []TSFieldInfo{}`). Need to:
- Analyze protogen.Message fields
- Map proto field types to TypeScript types
- Handle repeated fields, oneofs, and nested messages
- Generate proper default values

### 2. Cross-Package Import Resolution (Priority: HIGH)
- Implement external import detection for TypeScript
- Handle type dependencies across packages
- Generate proper import paths for cross-references

### 3. Browser Service Detection (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Implement logic to detect browser-provided services
- Set HasBrowserServices flag correctly
- Handle browser service registration in templates

### 4. Testing & Validation (Priority: HIGH)
- Create comprehensive test suite for split generators
- Validate generated code compiles and runs
- Test with browser-callbacks example
- Performance benchmarking vs old generator

## 📋 Medium-Term Goals

### 1. Feature Parity
- Ensure all features from monolithic generator work in split version
- Streaming support verification
- Custom template support
- All filtering options working

### 2. Migration Guide
- Document migration from old to new generators
- Create compatibility wrapper if needed
- Update all examples to use new generators

### 3. Documentation
- Complete API documentation for all layers
- Usage guide for split generators
- Template customization guide
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### 4. CI/CD Integration
- Add GitHub Actions for testing
- Automated release process
- Version compatibility matrix

## 🔮 Long-Term Vision

### 1. Additional Language Support
- Consider Python WASM generator
- Rust WASM generator
- Other target languages as needed

### 2. Advanced Features
- Hot reload support for development
- Source map generation
- Advanced debugging capabilities
- Performance profiling tools

### 3. Ecosystem Integration
- Buf Schema Registry integration
- VS Code extension
- Build tool plugins (webpack, vite, etc.)
- Framework integrations (React, Vue, Angular)

## 📊 Technical Debt to Address

1. **TODO Comments**: Several TODO items in code need addressing:
   - Field analysis in TSDataBuilder
   - External imports in TSDataBuilder
   - Oneof group analysis
   - Browser service detection

2. **Template Consolidation**:
   - Review if templates can be simplified
   - Consider template inheritance/composition

3. **Error Messages**:
   - Improve error messages with more context
   - Add suggestions for common issues

4. **Performance**:
   - Consider parallel generation for large projects
   - Template caching for repeated use
   - Memory usage optimization

## ✅ Success Criteria for Production Release

- [ ] All examples generate and run successfully
- [ ] Performance within 10% of old generator
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Migration guide available
- [ ] No known critical bugs
- [ ] Community feedback incorporated

## 📝 Notes

The refactoring to a split architecture has been successful. The new design provides:
- Better testability through layer separation
- Cleaner code organization
- Easier maintenance and extension
- Language-specific optimizations
- Improved error handling

The generators are now ready for broader testing and community feedback before the production release.
