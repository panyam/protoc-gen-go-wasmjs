# Next Steps

## Recently Completed (January 2025)
- ✅ **Enhanced Factory & Deserialization System**: Completed comprehensive factory composition and schema-aware deserialization
  - **Context-Aware Factory Methods**: Implemented parent object tracking, attribute names, and container keys for granular control
  - **Cross-Package Factory Composition**: Automatic dependency detection, import generation, and factory delegation across package boundaries
  - **Schema-Aware Deserialization**: Generated schema files with field metadata, proto field IDs, and oneof support for type-safe runtime processing
  - **Package-Scoped Registries**: Conflict-free multi-version support with fully qualified messageType names
  - **Factory-Deserializer Integration**: Seamless delegation between factory creation and deserializer population
  - **Production Testing**: 100% validation success with complex nested objects and real-world scenarios
  - **Enhanced Client Integration**: Demonstration client using the new deserializer system

- ✅ **Major Architecture Simplification**: Successfully completed TypeScript architecture transformation
  - **Self-Contained TypeScript Generation**: Eliminated dependencies on external TypeScript generators (protoc-gen-es, protoc-gen-ts)
  - **Simplified Client Architecture**: Replaced complex conversion system with direct JSON serialization
  - **Template-Based Generation**: Implemented interfaces, models, and factory generation using Go templates
  - **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed obsolete fields and streamlined configuration options
  - **Default Value Handling**: Fixed array and message type defaults with proper optional field support
  - **End-to-End Testing**: Validated complete architecture with working examples
  - **Performance Improvement**: Eliminated ~200 lines of complex conversion logic

- ✅ **Quality & TypeScript Refinements**: Latest round of critical bug fixes and improvements
  - **Native Map Type Support**: Fixed proto `map<K,V>` fields to generate native TypeScript `Map<K,V>` types instead of synthetic interfaces
  - **Framework Schema Architecture**: Separated framework types (`FieldType`, `FieldSchema`, `MessageSchema`) into dedicated `deserializer_schemas.ts` files
  - **Package-Based Generation**: Completed transition from file-based to package-based TypeScript generation eliminating import conflicts
  - **Type Safety Improvements**: Fixed factory method subscripting (`this[methodName]`) and `FactoryInterface` compatibility issues
  - **Build System Stability**: Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors and maintained 100% build success rate
