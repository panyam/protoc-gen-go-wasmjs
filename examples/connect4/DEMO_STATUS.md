# Connect4 Demo Status

## Current Implementation

The web demo you're running is a **client-side simulation** that demonstrates the UI and game logic. Each browser window runs independently.

## To Test Multi-Player (Current Demo)

1. **Window 1**: Create game with Game ID "demo-game", name "player1"
2. **Window 2**: Join game with Game ID "demo-game", name "player2"

**Note**: This creates separate game instances. For real multiplayer, we need the full WASM integration.

## Full Implementation Architecture

```
Browser A                   Browser B
┌─────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────┐
│ Stateful Proxy  │        │ Stateful Proxy  │
│ (TypeScript)    │        │ (TypeScript)    │
└─────────┬───────┘        └─────────┬───────┘
          │                          │
          │        WebSocket         │
          └──────────┬─────────────────┘
                     │
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ Game Server │
              │   (WASM)    │
              └─────────────┘
```

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **WebSocket Server**: Add real-time communication
2. **WASM Integration**: Connect to the compiled Go service
3. **Patch Synchronization**: Use the generated patch system
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent moves

## Generated Files Available

- ✅ WASM Service: `web/connect4_service.wasm`
- ✅ TypeScript Types: `gen/ts/connect4/`
- ✅ Patch System: `gen/ts/wasmjs/v1/patches_pb.ts`
- ✅ Go Service: Compiled and ready

## Demo Features Working

- ✅ Game creation/joining UI
- ✅ Board visualization  
- ✅ Piece placement with gravity
- ✅ Win detection
- ✅ Turn management
- ✅ Player management

## What You're Testing

The current demo shows:
1. How the UI would look and behave
2. Game logic and validation
3. Patch generation concepts (in console logs)
4. Real-time update patterns

This provides the foundation for connecting to the actual WASM service with stateful proxies!
