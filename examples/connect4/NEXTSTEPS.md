# Next Steps - Connect4 Example

## Recently Completed

### Player Management System
- **Simple Player IDs**: Converted from complex timestamps to clean numeric indices (0, 1, 2)
- **Player-Specific URLs**: Implemented `/GameName/players/0` pattern for direct player access
- **Auto-Player Selection**: URL-based automatic player selection with localStorage persistence
- **Cross-Tab Player Sync**: Player identity maintained across browser tabs and sessions

### Enhanced Transport System
- **Fixed IndexedDB Schema**: Resolved ConstraintError issues with auto-increment patches store
- **Patch Validation**: Added validation to prevent race conditions and empty state overwrites
- **Unique Patch IDs**: Implemented proper patch uniqueness for reliable cross-tab sync
- **Enhanced BroadcastChannel**: Improved real-time cross-tab messaging

### Async Callback Pattern Implementation
- **Problem Solved**: Browser→WASM→Browser deadlock when calling IndexedDB from WASM methods
- **Solution**: Implemented async method annotations with direct callback support
- **Service Methods Made Async**: `GetGame`, `CreateGame`, `JoinGame`, and `DropPiece` support async callbacks
- **Generator Templates Enhanced**: TypeScript and WASM templates generate proper async patterns

## Current State
- ✅ Async callback pattern fully implemented
- ✅ Browser→WASM→Browser deadlock resolved  
- ✅ Player-specific URLs with auto-selection working
- ✅ Simple numeric player ID system implemented
- ✅ Enhanced cross-tab synchronization with fixed IndexedDB schema
- ✅ Player selection modal and direct link buttons
- ✅ Game creation, joining, and piece dropping all functional
- ✅ Transport layer enhanced with proper patch validation

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Testing & Validation
- ✅ Test game creation flow (index page → player-specific URL)
- ✅ Test game loading flow (direct game URL access)
- ✅ Verify IndexedDB storage operations work without deadlocks
- ✅ Test cross-tab real-time synchronization
- [ ] Test edge cases in player URL handling
- [ ] Validate game state persistence across browser restarts

### 2. Code Cleanup
- ✅ Updated all player ID references to use simple indices
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in async callback chains
- [ ] Remove legacy static JS files if no longer needed
- [ ] Clean up remaining debug logs (optional - currently helpful for troubleshooting)

### 3. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Update README with player-specific URLs and simple player IDs
- ✅ Update DEMO_STATUS with current features
- ✅ Update ARCHITECTURE with player management system
- [ ] Update SETUP.md if build process has changed

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Static JS files (`connect4-game.js`, etc.) may need updating or removal
- [ ] Consider consolidating storage callback patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Cross-Browser Multiplayer
- [ ] Implement WebSocket server endpoint for real-time cross-browser play
- [ ] Add server-side game room management
- [ ] Implement transport auto-upgrade (IndexedDB → WebSocket when online)

### Enhanced Player Features
- [ ] Implement player authentication/accounts
- [ ] Add player statistics and game history
- [ ] Support for more than 2 players
- [ ] Implement spectator mode

### Game Features
- [ ] Add game replay functionality
- [ ] Implement different board sizes (configurable)
- [ ] Add time limits per move
- [ ] Implement tournament brackets

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Add timeout handling for async operations
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed storage operations
- [ ] Add progress indicators for async operations in UI
- [ ] Optimize patch sizes for large game states
